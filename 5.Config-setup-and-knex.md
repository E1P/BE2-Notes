# Intro to `knex` and project config


## Re-cap

- Which library have we been using so far for interacting with our PostgresQL database?


## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to setup a basic `knex` application.
- Learn how to use `knex` methods for inserting data into a postgresQL database.
- Learn how to handle references within data


## Project Config

First off, we need to install our dependencies:

```bash
npm i knex pg
```

* Next up, we can create a `knexfile.js`, this will contain all of the configuration information for knex. This will include the client adapter and the name of the database we are connecting to:


```js
const dbConfig = {
  development: {
    client: 'pg',
    connection: {
      database: 'mitch_imdb',
    },
  },
};
```

- `client` here specificies which client adapter we are using with the knex library (in this case `'pg'` for node-postgres)

- We also need to say that we are using the `"mitch_imdb"` database too. If we have a test DB - then we might need to use something like this:

```js
const dbConfig = {
  development: {
    client: 'pg',
    connection: {
      database: 'mitch_imdb',
    },
  },
  test: {
    client: 'pg',
    connection: {
      database: 'mitch_imdb_test',
    },
  },
};
```

We now have a config object for development and for testing environments!

We can also specify the directory where we want our seed function to be written into - this will look something like this:

```js
const dbConfig = {
  development: {
    client: 'pg',
    connection: {
      database: 'mitch_imdb',
    },
    seeds: {
      directory: './db/seeds',
    },
  },
  test: {
    client: 'pg',
    connection: {
      database: 'test_mitch_imdb',
    },
  },
};
```


Now any seed function we create will be written into the seeds folder.
- NOTE: ensure that your seeds object is nested inside the development object.

## process

Finally, we need to check which NODE environment we are in order to export the correct config object.  Our node environment can be either "test", "development" or "production".  We can find this information on the `process` object - a global object, used to provide information about and control over the current node.js process.

Within the `process` object there is another object - `process.env` - containing our environment variables, amongst them is `process.env.NODE_ENV`, this is just a string set to either 'test', 'development' or 'production'

Now in our `knexfile.js`, we can check the current NODE_ENV in order to export the development or test object, ensuring that in the case where the NODE_ENV hasn't been set we default it to 'development'

```js

const ENV = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';
// check the environment and default to 'development' if undefined

const dbConfig = {
  development: {
    client: 'pg',
    connection: {
      database: 'mitch_imdb',
    },
    seeds: {
      directory: './db/seeds',
    },
  },
  test: {
    client: 'pg',
    connection: {
      database: 'test_mitch_imdb',
    },
     seeds: {
      directory: './db/seeds',
    },
  },
};
module.exports = dbConfig[ENV];
// use square brackets to export either the test or the development object
```


Our folder structure should look something like this:

```raw
NC-Film-Night/
│
├── db/
│   ├── seeds/
│   │
│   └── test-setup.sql
│   │   
│   └── dev-setup.sql
│   │
│   └── connection.js
│
└── knexfile.js
```

- The key thing here is that there is a `knexfile.js` at the top level of our project, and a `db` folder that contains a `connection.js`.

### `setup.sql`

This file will create the test and dev database and their schemas from scratch

## Seeding data into our SQL database

Suppose that we have an existing SQL Database.  We could write a SQL script to insert data into the database - however, it could take a long time to write such a script especially as our data is currently an array.  By using the appropriate methods, we can programatically seed our database.


We can add a `seed.js` inside `./db/seeds` and write the following:

```js
exports.seed = function(knex, Promise) {
  // <-- logic for inserting our data here!
};
```

- This seed function currently takes `knex`, this is a connection object with a bunch of functions we can use for building a database query.  It also has a `Promise` parameter, as under the hood `knex` uses the bluebird promise library
( bluebird is meant to be better optimised than the native JS `Promise`! )
We can change this parameter from `knex` to `connection` so it is clearer what it is.

- If we wish to run our seed function then we can add the following script to our `package.json` :

```json
  "seed-db": "knex seed:run"
```

## Exporting test or development data

- We can introduce an `index.js` file into the `test-data` and `dev-data` folders in order to export the data from one file in the directory.
We can write:

```js
exports.filmData = require("./films");
exports.directorData = require("./directors");
```

- Here we are adding a key of `filmData` to the exports objects and assigning its value to be `require("./films")` - which is the just the array of film objects.
- We can do the same thing for the `directorData`


Then we can add an index.js file to our 


## Building the seed function


**STRATEGY**

- We need to be clear before we start building the seed function how exactly will we approach this problem.  The first thing we need to think about is **order** - do we seed directors or films first and importantly why?

- If we look at our SQL file then we can see that films have a director_id column that references the directors table.  In other words, we cannot insert the films until we have directors with their director_ids inside the SQL database.

- We can require our data into `seed.js` and then find the appropriate piece of knex documentation to see how we can insert data.

<!-- knex.insert([{title: 'Great Gatsby'}, {title: 'Fahrenheit 451'}], ['id']).into('books')
Outputs:
insert into `books` (`title`) values ('Great Gatsby'), ('Fahrenheit 451') -->

Above is a nice example from knex - plucked straight from the Query Builder section of the knex documentation.  From this we are accessing a method off the knex connection object and invoke the insert method with a single argument - an array of objects.  Each object in the array represents what will be a single row in the books table.  We can use this example to build our own insert query:

```js
const { directorData } = require("../data");

exports.seed = function(knex, Promise) {
  return knex.insert(directorData).into("directors").returning('*')
};
```
- The insert and into methods when chained like this will return a `Promise` as the insertion of data into the db is an asynchronous operation.  It is **essential** that our seed function returns a `Promise` for this to work.

- We can also chain `returning('*')`, which will mean the data we have just inserted into the db can be accessed in a callback function that we pass to our `then()` block

```js
const { directorData } = require("../data");

exports.seed = function(knex, Promise) {
  return knex.insert(directorData).into("directors").returning('*')
    .then(insertedDirectors => {
      console.log(insertedDirectors,'<-- an array of inserted directors')
    });
};
```

## Creating references

- Our raw data for films looks like this:

```js
[{
    title: 'The Shawshank Redemption',
    year_of_release: 1994,
    duration: 142,
    plot:
        'Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.',
    rating: 9.3,
    box_office: 58300000,
    director: 'Frank Darabont',
},
...
]
```

This is problematic as our directors table in the SQL database says that we must have director_id, a foreign key that references the directors in the other table.  This problem is akin to iterating over all the films and replacing the director with the corresponding director_id.
- A reference object is a way of storing information much like one would in a table.  The key will represent some piece of data and the value will be some different but corresponding piece of data.

We ultimately want a reference object that looks like this:
```js
{ 'David Fincher': 1,
  'Jonathan Demme': 2,
  'George Lucas': 3,
  'Carol Morley': 4,
  'Frank Darabont': 5,
  'Francis Ford Coppola': 6,
  'Penny Marshall': 7,
  'Lynne Ramsay': 8,
  'Robert Zemeckis': 9,
  'Nora Ephron': 10,
  'Greta Gerwig': 11,
  'Michel Gondry': 12,
  'Quentin Tarantino': 13,
  'Chris Nolan': 14,
  'Steven Spielberg': 15 }
```
With this object we can go through the films and replace each film string with a corresponding film_id.

### `createRef`

We can start to build a function called `createRef` that will take as its argument the 
`insertedDirectors` and return an object as above.

#### Test-case-1

```js
it('returns ref obj for an array with a single film object',() => {
  const insertedDirectors = [{ director_id : 1, director: 'Frank Darabont' }];
  const actual = createRef(insertedDirectors);
  const expected = {
    'Frank Darabont' : 1
  }
  expect(actual).to.eql(expected);
});
```

#### Test-case-2

```js
it('returns ref obj for an array with multiple distinct directors',() => {
  const insertedDirectors = [
  { director_id : 1, director: 'Frank Darabont'},
  { director_id: 2, director: 'Penny Marshall' }
  ];
  const actual = createRef(insertedDirectors);
  const expected = {
    'Frank Darabont' : 1,
    'Penny Marshall' : 2
  }
  expect(actual).to.eql(expected);
});
```

Above is an example of how me might set about testing a building a `createDirectorRef` function that returns a reference object as above.
