# Third Party APIs

## Watson Setup

1.  Create an [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration). **You may need to sign up on your phone**
2.  On the [Catalog page](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/?category=ai&search=label:lite), select the service you want to use and create it.
3.  Take some time to see what different offerings Watson provides.
    - you might want some background into how [Watson works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7E1TJ1HtM0)
    - or just see it beat some humans at [Jeopardy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFR3lOm_xhE)
4.  From the [Watson Dashboard](https://console.bluemix.net/dashboard/apps), select the service you will be using, and find your credentials here.

_It is ok to sign up to, and try out, multiple services_

5. Install the [Watson Developer Cloud Node SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/watson-developer-cloud).
6. Use an example from [the docs](https://console.bluemix.net/developer/watson/documentation) to get some results from Watson by just running the code with node.

## Promisifying The Watson SDK

See if you can promisify the Watson SDK. This will make your life easier later.

- Promises have 3 states: Pending, Rejected and Fulfilled.
- Once a promise is fulfilled or rejected, its value cannot change.
- To return a promise: `return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {})`.

Now try to integrate this as a model into an express server.
