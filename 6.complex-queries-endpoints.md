## Complex Queries


We are now in a position to start writing tests in order to build our API.

### Recap

* Why are we writing a seed function in the first place?
* Why are we using a test DB and a development DB?

### Learning Objectives

* Learn up how to structure models, controllers and tests when building an endpoint with full TDD.
* Learn how to more complex queries when designing the models
* Learn about additional SQL clauses like LIMIT, ORDER BY, etc...


### connection.js


First off, we can create a `connection.js` file: before the knex CLI created this object when we ran the seed script.  However, we can actually create the connection object ourselves:

```js

const dbConfig = require('../knexfile.js');
const knex = require('knex');
const connection = require('knex');
module.exports = connection;

```

- Here we are accessing the config for the database
- Requiring in the knex module and invoking it with the config
- This will create an object with a bunch of functions for querying the DB


### Setting up tests

Now we can set up a test script `app.spec.js` in order to start building out API

`app.spec.js`

It is imperative that we write our test first if we are correctly adhering to the TDD cycle - our test should inform which piece of functionality we are about to implement.  *Note what happens when we write the test and we omit the return statement when calling `request.get()`*

```js
process.env.NODE_ENV = 'test';
const app = require('../app');
const request = require('supertest')(app);
const { expect } = require('chai');


describe('mitch_imdb',() => {
    describe('/api/films', () => {
        it('responds with an array of film objects, each film having the right properties',() => {
            return request.get('/api/films')
                .expect(200);
         });
    });
});
```


- The first thing we do here is set our environment to 'test' -  this will ensure we are pointing to the test DB as we will export the test config from `knexfile.js`
- All our test does at the moment is check for status 200: in other words, all we need to pass this test is a route and a controller that will respond with the correct status code.



Now we can build our controller in `/controllers/films-controller.js`

```js
exports.getFilms = (req,res,next) => {
    res.status(200).send({ message: 'some films here' });
};
```

- This should pass our test as we are responding with the correct status code! Now we can make our test a little more ambitious - lets check we can respond with an array of film objects.


```js
describe('mitch_imdb',() => {
    describe('/api/films', () => {
        it('responds with an array of film objects, each film having the right properties',() => {
            return request.get('/api/films')
                .expect(200);
                .then(res => {
                    expect(res.body.films).to.be.an('array');
                    expect(res.body.films[0]).to.contain.keys('film_id','title','year_of_release','rating','box_office','duration','plot')
                });
         });
    });
});
```

Note here that we are not checking for the director key at the moment - we'll see why later on.

Now the function `getFilms` is a controller so ultimately it will have to invoke some other **model** function.  The model function will directly interface with the db: in other words, the model will query the database and retrieve some data for us.  Then afterwards the controller will respond with the data that the model gives us.

```js
const { fetchFilms } = require('../models/films-model.js');
exports.getFilms = (req, res, next) => {
    fetchFilms()
        .then(films => {
            res.status(200).send({});
        });
};
```
Now we can start to implement our model `fetchFilms`

```js
const connection  = require('../db/connection');

exports.fetchFilms = () => {
    return connection
        .select("*")
        .from("films");
};
```

This will pass our test at the moment as we are just responding with 200 and an array of all the films from our DB.  Each row in the postgresQL database will be turned into an object by `knex`.

What other features can we test for knext? Well before we ommitted the director key from the assertion, this is because this key belongs to another table and we'll have to do more work:

```js
it('each film object contains a director property',() => {
            return request.get('/api/films')
                .expect(200);
                .then(res => {
                    expect(res.body.films[0].director).to.be.a('string');
                });
         });
```

Now we need to do a JOIN in our model, using `knex` syntax.  We can find useful examples of knex syntax in the Query Builder section [here](https://knexjs.org/#Builder)
So we can further build our model by chaining the `.join()` method:

```js
const connection  = require('../db/connection');

exports.fetchFilms = () => {
    return connection
        .select('title','year_of_release','duration','plot','rating','name AS director')
        .from("films")
        .join("films.director_id","=","directors.director_id");
};
```
Hopefully, now we should get all the directors back in our database together with the director and not the director_id. Cool!  What could we test next? 
Suppose now we want now to check the number of directors - by default lets suppose our API responds with 10 films, we then need to check the default case (with NO query!)

```js
describe('mitch_imdb',() => {
    it('responds with right number of film objects (DEFAULT limit=10)',() => {
         return request.get('/api/films')
                .expect(200)
                .then(res => {
                    expect(res.body.films).to.have.length(10);
                });
    });
});
```

What is the minimum number of changes we need to make in order to pass this test?  We can appeal to the documentation for an example - however, first is there something we can use in SQL, another clause perhaps? YES!  We can use a limit clause, as follows:

```sql
SELECT name, title, year_of_release, duration, rating, box_office, plot FROM films
    JOIN directors
    ON directors.director_id = films.director_id
    LIMIT 10;
```
At the bottom of this query we can see there are now 10 rows.  Our task now is to find the knex documentation for this job.

```js

exports.fetchFilms = () => {
    return connection
        .select('title','year_of_release','duration','plot','rating','name AS director')
        .from("films")
        .join("films.director_id","=","directors.director_id")
        .limit(10)

```

Nice - all we need to do is chain a `.limit()` call at the end our model.  What could we test next?

```js
describe('mitch_imdb',() => {
    it('takes a limit query that alters the number of films that are served',() => {
         return request.get('/api/films?limit=3')
                .expect(200)
                .then(res => {
                    expect(res.body.films).to.have.length(10);
                });
    });
});
```
This test will certainly fail as we have fixed the limit as 10: how can we dynamically change the number that is passed to the limit function.  Lets take a look at the model again:

```js
exports.fetchFilms = ( { limit : maxResults } ) => {
    return connection
        .select('title','year_of_release','duration','plot','rating','name AS director')
        .from("films")
        .join("films.director_id","=","directors.director_id")
        .limit(maxResults)

```
Now we need to pass an object with a limit property to our model function - where will we do this?  Why in the controllers, of course!

```js

exports.getFilms = (req, res, next) => {
    fetchFilms(req.query)
        .then(films => {
            res.status(200).send({});
        });
};
```
* Here we are passing the whole of req.query into the fetchFilms model this is because `req.query` is an object created by express with key-value pairs representing the query paramters from the request URL
