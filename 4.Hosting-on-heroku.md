# Heroku

Heroku is a deployment servive that we can use to deploy node applications, such as express servers.
Heroku's guides are excellent and will take through the deployment process, step by step.

## Accounts

Heroku accounts can have up to 5 apps deployed on their free plan.
Sign up [here](https://www.heroku.com/).
Once you have signed up, head to the heroku dev center [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/) for all their wonderful guides.

## Deploying

* Install the [heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).
```bash
$ npm install -g heroku
```
* Enter your login details by using 
```bash
$ heroku login
```
* Once logged in, cd into your project folder and run heroku create `app-name-here`

```bash
$ cd ~/myproject
$ heroku create my-server
```
* Heroku create will add a new app to your account and if you have a git repo initialised in the project, add a remote named heroku. Each of your heroku apps will have it's own repo on heroku that it will use to make the live version of your app.

* Commit and push your app to the heroku remote. Heroku go through the build process, and your app is hosted!

```bash
$ git push heroku master
```

## Heroku build process

Heroku will follow a specific build process when you push changes to this repo:

* The repo is cloned
* npm install is ran
* enviroment variables are set
* The npm start script is run

Because of this any dependancies you have in your project must be include in your package json.

You must also provide a start script to make your server listen:

```json
    "start": "node listen.js",
```
## Enviroment variables

Heroku will set two env variables by default: 
NODE_ENV: 'production'
PORT: a number on the heroku servers
When our app listens it must use these variables to listen on e.g:

```js
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 9090;
app.listen(PORT, err => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}...`);
});
```

## Config

Our config files will be git ignored and as such will not be pushed to our heroku repo. This is good as it keeps our details safe but we will need to handle it in our app when it runs. We can add each of the variables we were storing in our config as an enviroment variable for heroku to set when it starts our app.
To add an enviroment variable, use the heroku config:set command

```bash
$ heroku config:set APIKEY=69wde92uisbjuwrr3o1
```

This will add a new variable and restart your app.

To see a list of all the variables you have use the commmand `heroku config`:

```bash
$ heroku config
```

At any point in your app where you use the config you will have to use the process.env instead. Ternaries will be your friend here:

```js
const { APIKEY } = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? process.env : require('../config')
```

## Herkou CLI commands

```bash
$ heroku login
```

Log in to you account 

```bash
$ heroku create ...
```
Creates a new app on heroku with a random name.

```bash
$ heroku create my-app
```
Creates a new app on heroku with the name my-app if it's available.

```
$ heroku config:set KEY=VALUE
```
Adds an enviroment varaible called KEY with a value of VALUE to your app.

```bash
$ heroku config
```
Shows all existing enviroment varaibles

```bash
$ heroku logs
```
Prints the logs of your app to the terminal

```bash
$ heroku logs --tail
```
Opens a live-feed of the most recent heroku logs in the terminal.
